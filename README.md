# Operating Sys for Cybersecurity

a1:

	This is a zig project that parces a text file, counts all instances of unique words in that file, and outputs each word and how many times it
	appears in the text. Words that only appear once are omitted for brevity. Words are considers strings seperated by whitespace or a newline
	for the purposes of the assignment. 

	To run main.zig, zig must be installed on your device natively. main.zig appears in the src file and text files appear in the input file. 
	Through the terminal, use the /zig run/ command followed by the main.zig file. Separate the source file with a space, two dashes, another
	space, and the file name. ex: zig run src/main.zig -- input/temple.txt
